## Description: "Temporal Greetings"

This JavaScript project aims to display the exact time of day and create an engaging visual experience based on the time of day. The user interface consists of a simple web page where the following interactions occur:

## Goal:

* Time Display: The project displays the current system time, allowing the user to know the exact time.

* Image Change: Depending on the time of day, the project changes the background image displayed on the page. For example, in the morning, it might show a sunrise image, during the day a blue sky image, and at night, a starry sky image.

* Background Color Change: In addition to the image, the background color of the page is adjusted according to the time of day. It might be light yellow in the morning, light blue during the day, and dark at night.


## Implementation

* Use the JavaScript Date API to obtain the current system time.

* Determine the time of day (morning, afternoon, or night) based on the obtained time.

* Dynamically update the background image and page background color based on the time of day.

* Display the current time on the page.

* Make sure to use JavaScript events to update the interface in real-time according to changes in time throughout the day.

This project provides an interactive and visually appealing way to display time information, making the user experience more enjoyable.
